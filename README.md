<h4>Virtual-X  is an Augmented Reality learning app which teaches about Planets in our Solar System.</h4>

<h5>About Virtual-X</h5>

Traditional education can be boring, passive, and one-size-fits-all. This can lead to disengagement and poor learning outcomes.

Poor infrastructure also leads to less than ideal quality of education

Most villages in India lack schools, much less devices to support quality education
